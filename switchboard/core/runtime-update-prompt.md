# Runtime Update Prompt

For regular maintenance work:
- Read `switchboard/core/playbook.md` first.
- Inspect system docs for dependencies and record agent/tool used.
- Update only `switchboard/local/tasks-completed.md`.
- Use one entry per meaningful update.
- Include timestamp, title, summary, changed paths, and routing tags.
- Include `Agent`, `Tool`, `Read Back`, and `Scope Check`.
- Use only these routing tags: `task`, `handoff`, `runbook`, `decision`, `scope`.
- If project-facing docs changed, add `Version`, `Readme`, `API`, and `Changelog` blocks as needed.
- If scope changed, include a `Scope Entries` block in the entry.
- If runtime config changed, include a `Runtime:` block in the entry.
- Finish by running `switchboard node snapshot --project-root <path>` and `switchboard node verify-update --project-root <path>`.
